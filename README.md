Build a Markdown Previewer - Free Code Camp React Projects

## About

Build a Markdown Previewer 

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

Rule #3: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
